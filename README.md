## Notes
#### What is the distributed web?
A peer-to-peer model of the Web where data is stored in a distributed way across computers in a network, instead of aggregated in a few huge computers (data centers).

#### Notes on [The end of the cloud: A truly serverless web](https://blog.red-badger.com/2017/10/13/the-end-of-the-cloud-a-truly-serverless-web):
##### Benefits of a distributed web
- **People would have direct control over their own data**
- Less vulnerable to hacks, since there would be no centralized location for a hacker to obtain mass amounts of user data
- Possibly more efficient usage of Internet bandwidth [todo: investigate further]
##### The current state of the Internet
- A handful of tech giants have essentially monopolized the Web
- In 2018, Netflix and Youtube accounted for [26% of all Internet traffic in the world](http://fortune.com/2018/10/02/netflix-consumes-15-percent-of-global-internet-bandwidth/)
##### Problems with the current state of the Internet
- *Monopolization of data*
  - Big tech companies store & control huge amounts of user data
  - There is no real transparency into how companies use this data
  - While users ostensibly have control over their own data (i.e. they can deny permissions or delete information), they have no way of verifying that what they requested was done (see all of the 2018 Facebook data scandals)
- *Storage and bandwidth constraints*
  - As media like HD videos and VR experiences become more and more popular, the volume of data being transmitted across the Internet is increasing
  - Network bandwidth is not growing at a fast enough rate to accommodate this [todo: get source]

#### Open Questions
- What are the biggest technical problems that have to be solved before a distributed web is viable?
- Could this ever realistically replace the current Web?
